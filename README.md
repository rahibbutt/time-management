# Time Management System

A simple and functional time tracking web application built with Vue 3 
and PrimeVue, designed for employee time recording.
This project simulates the essential features of a basic time 
management system and demonstrates modern full-stack development 
skills, including component-driven architecture, API integration, 
form handling and persistent data storage.

## üöÄ Features

### 1. User Authentication
- JWT-based login and registration system
- Role-based access (admin vs. employee)

### 2. Clock In / Clock Out
- Button to start and stop working time
- Time periods are saved to the database
- Multiple time blocks possible per day

### 3. Customer Management
- Create, edit and delete customers
- Customer fields: name, email, phone

### 4. Project Management
- Projects are assigned to specific customers
- Fields: project name, description and customer associated

### 5. Task Entries
After clocking in, users can optionally select or describe a task, 
assign the task to a project. This information is saved with the time block

### 6. Daily Working Time Overview
- Visualization of tracked time per day
- Table and bar chart views (via PrimeVue Chart)
